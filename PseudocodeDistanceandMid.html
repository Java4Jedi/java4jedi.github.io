<p>1. Import scanner and begin while loop sequence</p>
<p>2. Scan for coordinates</p>
<p>3. First take Distance</p>
<p>4. Plug coordinates into Sqrt(|x2-x1|^2+|y2-y1|^2)</p>
<p>5. Create var x3, y3 set x3 = (x1+x2)/2 and y3 = (y1+y2)/2</p>
<p>6. Problem is irrational numbers, so take variable with just |x2-x1|^2+|y2-y1|^2</p>
<p>7. If irrational, add sqrt symbol + |x2-x1|^2+|y2-y1|^2</p>
<p>8. Print out (x3, y3)</p>
<p>9. Ask to run again</p>
<p>10. If yes, loop back to one, if no, proceed (while loop definition)</p>
<p>11. Exit code with last statement</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That was moderately easy! My last project is the hardest I&rsquo;ve done so far, so the code will increase in difficulty as you move forward!</p>
